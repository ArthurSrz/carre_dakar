Carré de Dakar Existence Theorem

Problem Statement:
The "Carré de Dakar" is a mathematical puzzle where we must fill an n×n grid
with natural numbers and arithmetic operators (+, -, ×, =) such that:
1. Every row forms one or more valid arithmetic equations
2. Every column forms one or more valid arithmetic equations
3. An equation has the form: number operator number ... = result

Question:
For every integer n > 3, does there always exist at least one valid way to
fill the grid?

Prove or disprove:
∀n ∈ ℕ, n > 3 ⟹ ∃ valid n×n Carré de Dakar configuration

Constructive approach:
Show that we can build a valid grid using simple patterns:
- Base pattern: a + b = c where c = a + b
- Tile the grid with 5×5 blocks containing valid equations
- Ensure row and column equation validity at block boundaries

Expected result: TRUE - solutions always exist for n > 3
