Simplified Carré de Dakar Existence Theorem

Informal Statement:
"For every integer n greater than 3, there exists at least one way to fill
an n×n grid with numbers and operators (+, -, ×, =) such that all arithmetic
equations (both horizontal and vertical) are valid."

Question: Prove or disprove this statement.

This is equivalent to asking: Can we always construct a valid Carré de Dakar
puzzle for any grid size n > 3?
