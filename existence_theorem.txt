Theorem: Existence of Solutions for Carré de Dakar

Statement: For every integer n greater than 3, there exists at least one valid n×n grid configuration for the Carré de Dakar puzzle.

Definitions:
- Let n be a positive integer, n > 3
- A Carré de Dakar grid G is an n×n matrix
- Each cell G[i,j] contains either:
  * A positive integer (number)
  * An arithmetic operator from the set {+, -, ×}
  * An equals sign (=)

Validity Conditions:
1. Every row and every column must form at least one valid arithmetic equation
2. An arithmetic equation has the form: a₁ op₁ a₂ op₂ ... opₖ aₖ₊₁ = result
   where aᵢ are positive integers and opᵢ ∈ {+, -, ×}
3. Equations are evaluated left-to-right with standard operator precedence (× before +/-)
4. The result after evaluation must equal the value after the = sign

Question: Prove or disprove that for all n > 3, at least one valid grid G exists.

Approach 1 - Constructive Proof:
Show an explicit construction algorithm that always produces a valid grid for any n > 3.

Approach 2 - Existence via Example:
Demonstrate that if a valid grid exists for n=4, we can extend it to any larger n.

Approach 3 - Counterexample:
Find some n > 3 for which no valid grid can be constructed.

Please formalize this problem and provide:
1. A rigorous proof of existence (if true)
2. A counterexample (if false)
3. The computational complexity of finding solutions
